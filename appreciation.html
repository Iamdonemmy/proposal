                       Teetosewa, you just made my heart skip a thousand beats and my soul sing louder than ever.
                    <br>
                    Saying YES means more than words can capture,  it means you trust me with your forever, and I promise to honor it with everything I am.
                
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I promise to love you fiercely, gently, and without hesitation.
I promise to protect your heart, to cherish your motherly care, and to never take a single moment with you for granted.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Through every joy, every challenge, every quiet moment, and every loud laughter, I will choose you. Every day, again and again.
            <br>
            From our first meeting at Federal Polytechnic Ilaro, through thick and thin, ups and downs, struggles and triumphs this is our forever beginning.
            <br>
            Teetosewa, my love, my life, my answered prayer
            Let’s write the rest of our story together, hand in hand, heart to heart, for always. 💍❤️✨
