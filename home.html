        <h2> DEAR TEETOSEWA</h2>

        <p class="p1">
            When we began this journey on August 6, 2018, I already understood what love meant but loving you gave that understanding a heartbeat.

            Through the thick and thin, the hard seasons and the joyful ones, the misunderstandings, the growth, you never stopped caring. You never stopped choosing us.
        </p>

        <p class="p2">
            Your motherly kind of love , the way you check on me, worry about me, pray for me, and make sure I’m okay  is something I will forever cherish. You love me in a way that feels safe. In a way that feels like home.
            <br>
            We have seen each other at our weakest and still chose to stay.
            <br><br>
            Loving you is not just a feeling for me. <br>
            It is commitment,  It is peace, It is growth.<br>
            I don’t just want more years with you    I want a lifetime. <br>
            And that is why this moment means everything to me.
        </p>
